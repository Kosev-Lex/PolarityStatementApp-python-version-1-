# Polarity Statement Explorer

This is an interactive educational tool, created to demonstrate the concept of
polarity statements; a term I created - see my website for more information. It operates via a GUI interface to allow the user to 
investigate polarity statements across numerous contexts and in varying degrees
of complexity. It shows how two opposing camps can affirm the truth of the same 
statement but for different reasons, that hinges on a pivot term, and derive divergent, 
polar, interpretations from the same source. 


## Features


- Pivot term highlighting,
- Group divergence labels,
- 130 high-fidelity examples with descriptive notes,
- Visual pendulum scale (NOTE: not operational in this version, still developing content)


## Setup

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
